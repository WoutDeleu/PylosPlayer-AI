### Pylos AI Player with Branch and Bound Algorithms 🎲

Welcome to the Pylos AI Player project, developed as part of the AI course at KU Leuven. In this project, we've created an AI player for the board game Pylos, leveraging the power of branch and bound algorithms.

🧠 **Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to design an AI player capable of playing Pylos, a challenging board game. We've harnessed the potential of branch and bound algorithms to make strategic decisions and outplay human opponents.

🎮 **Pylos Game**
Pylos is a two-player board game where the objective is to place pieces and form a line of four pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The twist is that the game is played on a 4x4x4 board, allowing for complex strategies and tactics.

🤖 **AI Strategy**
Our AI player employs branch and bound algorithms to make optimal moves and strategically outperform human players. It considers various possible moves, evaluates their consequences, and selects the best option to ensure victory.

🕹️ **Enjoy Playing and Learning!**
The Pylos AI Player offers a challenging and fun gaming experience while demonstrating the power of AI algorithms. Play, learn, and outsmart the AI player in Pylos!
